## Code Overview

The entire application is encapsulated within a single, well-structured file (`App.tsx`), demonstrating a cohesive component-based architecture.

  * **Type Definitions**: All necessary TypeScript types and interfaces are defined at the top for clarity.
  * **App Provider & Context (`AppContext`)**: A global state manager for theme, toasts, pages, and cropped images.
  * **Styling & Layout Components**: `GlobalStyles`, `Card`, and `PageWrapper` provide consistent styling and structure.
  * **Perspective Transform Helpers**: The `perspectiveTransform` and `gaussianElimination` functions contain the core mathematical logic for the smart crop feature.
  * **Main Logic (`ToolPages`)**: This is the central component that handles the application's state (`cropping`, `editing`, `idle`) and renders the appropriate UI for each page (`scanner`, `gallery`, `id_card_maker`).
  * **Core App Component (`App`)**: The root component that sets up the context provider, routing (via URL hash), and overall layout.
  * **UI Components**: Reusable components like `Sidebar`, `Header`, `Modal`, and `Toast` are defined to build the application's interface.
